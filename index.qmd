Welcome to the PLIER models based on recount3 website, where you can find detailed analyses and results from applying PLIER models to recount3 data.

PLIER is a matrix factorization approach that decomposes gene expression data into a product of a small number of LVs and their corresponding gene associations or loadings, while constraining the loadings to align with the most relevant automatically selected subset of prior knowledge.
